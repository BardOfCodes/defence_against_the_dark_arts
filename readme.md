e Against The Dark Arts

A repository containing evaluation of various universal adversarial perturbations against various defense mechanisms.

## The Attacks
I evaluated the following 3 Universal Adversarial attacks:

1) Universal Adversarial Perturbations []().

2) Generalizable Objective for Universal Adversarial Perturbations[]().

3) Network for Adversarial generation()[].

I Look forward to anyone willing to contribute more perturbations to test ( UAPs specifically).

## The Defenses

The following defenses were evaluated

1) Prediction using multiple crops of input

2) Gaussian smoothing, Median smoothing, and Bilateral Filtering

3) JPEG Compression []()

4) BIT compression[]()

5) TV-minimization []()

6) Image-quilting []()

7) Perturbation rectification network []()

Of course, you can contribute your defenses. 

# But why?

Well, UAPs are indeed quite a big threat to anyone using deep learning, be it muggles or wizards. They are indeed the perfect curse that a Death Eater might use against your Deep model. Drawing parallels, I thought it will be interesting to see defenses in this light. **Truth be told:**, I just want you to [give me a star](https://youtu.be/VqSL8q2WGaU?t=1m3s).
